In our templates, we will often want to include parts from other templates, parts like footers, headers, menus…

In order to do this, Thymeleaf needs us to define these parts, “fragments”, for inclusion, which can be done using the th:fragment attribute.

Say we want to add a standard copyright footer to all our grocery pages, so we create a /WEB-INF/templates/footer.html file containing this code:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">

  <body>
  
    <div th:fragment="copy">
      &copy; 2011 The Good Thymes Virtual Grocery
    </div>
  
  </body>
  
</html>
The code above defines a fragment called copy that we can easily include in our home page using one of the th:insert or th:replace attributes (and also th:include, though its use is no longer recommended since Thymeleaf 3.0):

<body>

  ...

  <div th:insert="~{footer :: copy}"></div>
  
</body>
